### **📌 Project Description (README.md)**  

# 🎭 **AI-Powered Facial Expression Detection with Arduino & LED Display** 💡  

This project integrates **MediaPipe FaceMesh** 🤖 with **Arduino-controlled LED matrix** ✨ to detect facial expressions **in real-time** and visually represent them using **NeoPixel LEDs**. The system recognizes **smiling, neutral, and angry expressions** and updates the LED display accordingly.

## **🚀 Features**  
✅ **Real-time Facial Expression Detection** 🎭  
✅ **MediaPipe FaceMesh-based AI Processing** 🧠  
✅ **Arduino & NeoPixel Integration for LED Visualization** 🔵🟢🔴  
✅ **Multi-Process Architecture with Python & Serial Communication** 🔄  
✅ **Live Camera Feed with Expression Overlay** 🎥

## **🛠️ How It Works**  
1️⃣ **Camera captures the user's face** 🎥  
2️⃣ **MediaPipe FaceMesh processes facial landmarks** 🧠  
3️⃣ **Expression classification (Smile, Neutral, Angry) based on key facial points** 🧐  
4️⃣ **Detected expression sent to Arduino via multiprocessing** 🔄  
5️⃣ **NeoPixel LEDs light up in corresponding colors** 🎨

## **🖥️ Installation & Setup**  
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
```sh
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pinpong
```

### **2️⃣ Connect Arduino & NeoPixel**  
Ensure your **Arduino board** is connected via USB and the correct **port** is specified in the code.

### **3️⃣ Run the Python Script**  
```sh
python main.py
```

Press **'Q'** to exit the program.

## **🎮 Expression-to-LED Mapping**  
| **Expression** | **LED Color** | **LED Pattern** |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| 😊 **Smiling** | 🟢 Green | Lights up specific pixels for a "smile" shape |
| 😐 **Neutral** | 🔵 Blue | Lights up a balanced face pattern |
| 😠 **Angry** | 🔴 Red | Lights up an "angry" face pattern |
